# Evaluation of Environmental Degradation Kinetics Using Hierarchical Bayesian Modeling

The code and data in this repository can be used to generate the results found in the following publication: 
> Yu Yun, Steinschneider Scott, and Reckhow David A. “Evaluation of Environmental Degradation Kinetics Using Hierarchical Bayesian Modeling.” Journal of Environmental Engineering 141, no. 12 (December 1, 2015): 06015008. https://doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)EE.1943-7870.0000997.

To run the code, download or [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) the repository to your computer. Then, open the ```han-fate.Rproj``` RStudio Project file in [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/).


Once the project has been opened, open and source the ```R/Bayesian HAN_Dynamic CT.R``` file. If you have JAGS installed (see *Dependencies* below), the Bayesian modeling will begin! 

## Dependencies
Before running this program, you must have JAGS-4.x.y.exe (for any x >=0, y>=0) installed to perform the Bayesian modeling. 
This can be found at the following website: [https://sourceforge.net/projects/mcmc-jags/files/rjags/4/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mcmc-jags/files/rjags/4/)
